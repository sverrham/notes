# Got a Spartan-6 FPGA SP605 Eval kit
So I got a Spartan-6 SP605 Evaluation kit for free, these are discontinued, but I want to see if I can get it up and play around with it.

It has a SFP cage, thats nice, would like to get that working.

Also PCIe Gen1 would be nice to experiment with.

Video DVI/VGA would be interesting.
Among other interfaces.

## Setup
SW and licensing? It seems I have the rev D board, so tool version is ISE Design Suite 13.4 that is latest.

The eval kit should have a node-locked license, so probably need to contact Xilinx support to get that sorted.
The latest ISE 14.7 at least did not need a license to build, the webpack license seemed to work fine.

Seems problematic with ISE, trying the ISE 14.7 win 10, its a VM version. so it should work in windows 10 (11?).

This needs virtual box 5.2
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download_Old_Builds_5_2

ISE 14.7 win 10 installer does not work on windows 11, claims virtualization is not enabled in BIOS, but I have it enabled so that is not the problem.
I can import the .ova file from the ova folder in the Xilinx install folder.
 
That did not work still complained about virtualization not enabled.
Fond this: https://helpdeskgeek.com/virtualization/how-to-fix-vt-x-is-not-available-verr_vmx-no-vmx-error-in-virtualbox/
And following that setting the hyper-v feature off it looks like the virtual machine starts with ISE 14.7!!!

Re adding the Hyper-v feature for wsl this stopped working, but updating virtualbox to version 7.0.16 the virtual machine started up.

Adding a shared folder to the VM settings, need to mount the shared folder in the VM

```sudo mount -t vboxsf projects projects```

In the shared folder settings one can just mark it as auto mount and its mounted when the virtual machine boots.

Here the mount and share is named projects.

Trying the DDR3 example.
Hmm, did not give me much.


Started a new project to try to get a blinky working.
Seems I managed to make something and compile it into a programming file...
Got blinky running on the board. example code in blinky folder.
